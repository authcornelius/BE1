            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Recently, I faced a challenging issue while developing an API for a job application platform. The task was to create a robust and secure API that allows users to apply for jobs, including uploading their resumes. The complexity arose from the need to handle multiple file types, ensure data validation, and securely store user information in a MongoDB database.</p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Solution</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Setting Up the Environment</h3>
            <p>First, I set up my development environment using Node.js and Express. These technologies provide a solid foundation for building scalable and efficient backend services.</p>
            <pre>
<code>
mkdir job-application-api
cd job-application-api
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose multer
</code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Step 2: Creating the Express Server</h3>
            <p>Next, I created the basic structure of the Express server. This included setting up middleware for JSON parsing and defining the initial routes.</p>
            <h3>Step 3: Defining the Mongoose Schema</h3>
            <p>To ensure data validation and structure, I defined a Mongoose schema for the job applications. This schema included fields for the applicant's name, email, job ID, and the resume file.</p>
            <h3>Step 4: Setting Up File Upload with Multer</h3>
            <p>Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files. I configured Multer to handle resume uploads and store them in a designated folder.</p>
            <h3>Step 5: Creating the POST Route</h3>
            <p>The next step was to create the POST route that handles job applications. This route validates the input data, handles the file upload, and saves the application to the MongoDB database.</p>
